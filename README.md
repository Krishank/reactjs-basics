    import { render } from "react-dom"

    class App extends React.Component {
      render(){
        return(
          <h1>Hello React First Component</h1>
        )
      }
    }
    render(<App/>, window.document.getElementById('app'));

```
# 03: multiple-components:

# 04: events:
Hot to attach and use events in React

# 05: passing-data-bw-componenets-props:
How to pass data to a component for its dynamic behavior

# 06: states

# 07: data-passing-bw-components
Passing data bw components using props

# 08: two-way-data-binding
As the name suggest it's 2-way data binding but itâ€™s pretty fast


# 09: react-life-cycle
Discuss about react life cycle also fine the images on the root for more theoretical update

# 10: stateless-components
Avoid states in your component make it stateless or pure function remember pure component is a separate topic we will cover.


# 11: react16/Fragment
New React16 feature no longer need to wrap your components in a container

``` html
      <React.Fragment>
          <p>In a new Home Component!</p>
          <p>Hello My Name is: {this.props.name} and my age is {this.state.age} in {this.state.year}</p>
          <hr/>
          <button className="btn btn-primary" onClick={()=>this.onMakeOlder()}>My Age is {this.state.age} in {this.state.year}</button>
          <hr/>
         <input type="text" onChange={(event)=> this.onHandleChange(event)} value={this.props.intialLinkName}></input><button className="btn btn-primary" onClick={()=>this.onChangeText()}>Click To Change Header Text</button>
      </React.Fragment>

```        

# 11: react16/ErrorBoundary
A new powerful feature of React16 to have a ErrorBoundary for your components so you can catch debug and show a proper error when error occurs

``` html

    <ErrorBoundary>
                    <Home/>
    </ErrorBoundary>

```

# 12: react16/contextAPI:
As in React we pass data via props to components suppose if we have a component in nth level this will be a big pain to pass that data to all component as a prop even if they are not using it no issue now we can use contextAPI comes with React16.

# 13: react-memo-component

This is also a new feature of react as all the stateless component or stateless function will render if there parent re render we can Avoid that with pure component but now we also have memo component which are much faster than stateless components please read the React16 documentation for more info.

``` javascript
  import React from "react";

  export const Header = React.memo(function Header(props) {
    return (
        <nav className="navbar navbar-default">
            <div className="container">
                <div className="navbar-header">
                    <ul className="nav navbar-nav">
                        <li><a href={props.link}>{props.linkText}</a></li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
            </div>
        </nav>
    );


```
